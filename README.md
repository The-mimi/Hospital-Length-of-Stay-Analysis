# Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Analysis

**Overview**
<p>This analysis explores hospital Length of Stay (LOS) using the SPARCS de-identified dataset filtered for Albany Medical Center. The objective is to identify operational patterns and opportunities to reduce LOS, improve efficiency, and optimize patient outcomes.<p>

**Key Insights**
- Average LOS: 6.3 days | Total Charges: $141  million
- Longest Stays: Urgent (7.1 days) and Age 70+ (7.7 days)
- Insurance Impact: Medicare patients – 7.8 days average LOS
- Severity Correlation: r = 0.46 (strongest predictor of LOS)
- Potential savings: 1-day LOS reduction ≈ $22.1 million annual savings

**Data & Tools Used**
- **Dataset**: SPARCS De-Identified ( Albany Medical Center subset, 7,774 patients-2021).
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, matplotlib), Adobe Illustrator (for visuals).
- **Focus**: Health operations, cost reduction, and patient flow optimization.​

**​Deliverables**
- **Python Analysis Notebook**: data prep, correlation modeling, and visual outputs.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: LOS distribution by demographics and disease categories.
- **Slide Deck**: SQL logic and code methodology (linked separately).
(Dashboard and Slide Deck are linked below.)
